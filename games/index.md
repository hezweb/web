## Core Principles

We dislike the need for account registration, obligatory introductions on forums or Discord servers, lengthy community rule readings, and commitments to timed events.

We believe that gaming should be straightforward and enjoyable, not a time-consuming endeavor.

While our gaming servers are online most of the time, the scheduled gaming sessions offer the best opportunity to find a gaming buddy.

We reserve the right to take action, including kicking and banning individuals, in order to uphold this standard of friendliness and respect within our community.
